title: PRIVILEGE

PRIVILEGE - I have been constantly grappling with this term and what it entails since my trip to India. It hit me distinctly when I stepped into the XII Science Classroom of a public school in a small town of Ahwa, Gujarat, India. I was there to talk about NEF (Nanubhai Education Foundation), a non-profit organization that provides scholarships to financially vulnerable girls from rural India for college. I was tagging along with a friend to volunteer with the foundation for a week. 
As soon as we entered the classroom, all eyes were transfixed on us. As we got introduced by their teacher, I wondered what it is that I could say to them? I felt my hands were getting a little cold, and I was not even prepared for this. But before I knew it, I was talking about how I got a scholarship during my undergrad years, how it helped my family and how far I have come in life. I guess I wanted to perhaps make myself more relatable to them in some way, more like if I can do it you can too.
After my unmoving speech about my life I thought maybe we should make this a little interactive. I posed a question to them - What do you want to pursue after 12th? 
Not a single girl raised their hand, I asked again insisting anyone to share their dreams. Still no response. I picked out a few girls - asked them several times to speak - they did not utter a single word. 
Realizing my disappointment, their teacher jumped in and picked out two girls - both of them wanted to be a nurse/doctor. Being a boastful engineer, I asked who wants to be a software engineer - the girls looked a little puzzled, I corrected myself to a computer engineer. And not a single boy or girl raised their hands. I was appalled that none of these kids were curious or interested in software as a profession. As we wrapped up our visits that day to other schools in nearby areas, I could not help but feel unsettled. I wondered why those girls did not speak up in the first place, how could they be so shy? 
A teacher later that day explained to me that these girls come from families where there are not conditioned to voice their opinion, or even have one for that matter. They are indeed super shy, even with their teachers whom they see everyday. The teachers have to learn to read their body language - they usually can catch on implicit cues to see if a girl is distressed. And then later find some alone time with her to ask her if she has any difficulties/concerns. And most times the girls complain that the are not able to focus on studying because of conditions at home/ or that their family is discouraging towards them continuing in school. Their parents are barely educated, and do not prioritize education at all. 
Moreover, when you are that poor your focus is just survival - how can you get the next meal for your family? If our daughter gets way too educated - she might not find a groom from our community. She would ultimately just take care of a family - so why study beyond school?
Although I came from a lower middle class family, where my dad had struggled a lot as a kid for survival, I have never really had to battle with basic needs in my life.
I quickly realized in a day, how naive I was to even think that those girls could relate to my life history. While we all talk about equality where we don't have to worry about where our next meal would come from, would we get water to drink/wash? we fail to understand that we live in a society with extreme inequality. The mere idea of where you are born - country/ family can dictate a lot of your fundamental structure and circumstances in life. And when we sit in our fine apartments, well-paid jobs sipping a cup of fresh brewed coffee wondering what our passions are, or purpose of life is? Even in those distressing moments of ours, we are super PRIVILEGED. 
Now while most of us get more than just our basic needs met, there is a much larger population of humans out there who could not even dream to be where we are at. It's a hard fact to digest - at least it took me quite a few days to really completely grasp it.

TAKEAWAY -
While I have battled with this question of “purpose of life” myself for quite a while now I have come to believe that fundamental purpose of any life is to always SURVIVE. But if you are privileged you get to define what that SURVIVAL looks like. So while we continue to figure out a privileged blueprint of life, let's pause once in a while - be thankful and then help people out there really survive. 
How is that for some perspective, huh?
